                <p><b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet <ins>(World Wide Web)</ins> or an intranet <i>(a private network)</i>.[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to <em>complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services</em>. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include <mark>Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development</mark>.

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>

    <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>

    <p><b>Tim Berners-Lee created</b> the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]

The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <ins>HTML was developed in 1993</ins>.[6]

<em>Web 1.0</em> is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]</p>

    <h3>Web 2.0</h3>

    <p>Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.[9][10]

<mark>Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication</mark>. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as <i>a user-focused, read-write online network</i>.[7]

In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies.<sup>[11]</sup> The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the <b>"backbone of the internet,"</b> using standardized XML <del>(Extensible Markup Language)</del> tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and online databases.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

    <h3>Web 3.0 </h3>

    <p>Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the <i>integration of metadata, precise information delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests</i>.[citation needed]

<mark>Web 3.0</mark> aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve <ins>identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles</ins>.[7]

This version is sometimes also known as <strong>Semantic Web</strong>.[12]</p>
